			<h1>Visualization Principles</h1>
			<p>This visualization uses martini glass structure which takes the user through the Dataset of the Google Review Analysis in the year of 2019
                . The dataset itself aggregates user rating for more than 10,000 Applications from the Google Play Store. However, due to
                the consideration of loading time, this analysis filter the data to the size of 2,000. This visualization focuses on the Content Rating
                applied to different age groups. Inp articular, they are 18+, 15+, 7+(mature) and everyone(all-age).</p>
			<h2>Interactive Slideshow structure</h2>
			<p> The pattern will investigate some tangent that you might be interested in, in our case, they will be the relayionship between
                content rating and rate score as well as content rating verses installation numbers. Users have the freedom to
                choose just to continue on if you're not interested in the details of that slide.</p>
			<h2>Managing the Dataset</h2>
			<p>With such a large dataset, creating a visualization with the raw data turned out to be very difficult. The first step for created 
				this visualization was to process the dataset and focus on the data pertaining restaurants in the United States only.</p>
			<h2>Templates Structure</h2>
			<p> To facilitate a cohesive and smooth look for the interactive visualization, the transition is implemented to capture users' scroll activities
                . Additionally there is a page navigation bar to help user navigate between different pages. With mose hover on the navigation dots,
				the user can see the title of all pages alter alters the display sequence.
				This helps user better understanding the thinking pattern from the author.</p>
			<h2>Annotations</h2>
			<p>Annotations have been used in all visualizations with a generic css pattern to annotate key findings. For example, user might get lost
				when looking through the overview bubble chart becuase the size of data is overwhelming. Then in between of each user activities, such like
				clicking buttons, the annotation which the author wants to convey will pop up on the screen to remind the user what the problem is.
				Certainly, the annotation will disappear when user is performing the next activity.</p>
			<h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
			<p>Both parameters and triggers are used in all visualizations. For the Bubble Chart Visualization, parameters for the
				x,y co-ordinates of each bubble are set to an initial central position for the All Reviews Visualization. As a user selects menu 
				items to chose between All Reviews, Reviews by State and Reviews by Stars, it triggers the change of bubble’s x,y co-ordinates 
				parameter to their respective groupings.</p><br />
			<p> In the bar chart presentation, to help user partition the dataset and narrow down to the specific group of users,
				These parameters are triggered to be updated as mouseover tooltips as well as the dropdown selection for free and paid Apps.
				This can provide the user with a snapshot of the amount of installations for a given group. Meanwhile, the sort bar will help the
			    user to view all the bars in a sequence if they need to.</p>

			<h1>The Dataset Information</h1>
			<p>​​The dataset was provided by researches regarding Google Analytics performed on 2019. The dataset gathered a list of applications published to
			Google Play Store in a wide range of categories. Fields include their ratings, names, the size of the Apk packages and others. The following
			analysis will use those attributes to group data and display charts</p><br />

			<p>Assumptions are made in the positive correlation between the number of installs and the popularity of a application. This is then tied with
				the assumption of the positive correlation between number of downloads and the popularity of a business. By focusing on application published in
				Google store which have large number of installs, and high score rating, we will be able to understand what kinds of applications are trending
				in Android world.</p>

			<h1>Overall Finding</h1>
			<p> The high-level overall view shows that there is a negative correlation between the number of published application verses the
			level of content restriction. In other words, as the application is available to a wider range of users in different ages, then the restriction
			is more linient, thus there are more author publishing to the Google Play Store </p>
			<h2>Customer Rating against Content Rating</h2>
			<p>As the distribution shows regarding customer rating (sclred from 1 to 5), as the application is more restricted to mature people, the
			average customer rating tends to be lower. On the contrary side, when the application contains fewer restrited content, the review is less controversial
			and most people opt to rate 3 or 4 stars</p>
			<h2>Prices and Number of Installations</h2>
			<p>As we partition the number of free applications and the number of paid applications, such as the seperation in Google Play Store, we found
				that there are more applications with age restriction. In particular, most of the free application are welcomed to all age people, while
				the proportion of age restricted applications takes a greater occupation for paid Apps in terms of number of isntallations</p>
